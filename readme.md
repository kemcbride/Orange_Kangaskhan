## Neolib Scripts

These are the scripts I run with some amount of regularity,
that automate playing neopets.
If you read them, you will find out how basic they are, and also how bad I am at coding.

But you'll also find out how to get something that kind of works!

\*Note: I'll try to annotate these scripts to describe which parts work, since
they usually do break at some point.
